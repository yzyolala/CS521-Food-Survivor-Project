## Name of the project
**Food Survivor**

## Description
The purpose of Food Survivor is to reduce food waste in Hoboken and Jersey City. It is a useful website that connects restaurants and stores which have unsold, surplus food, with customers who can then buy whatever food the outlet considers surplus to requirements—without being able to choose—at a much lower price than normal. The food on the website is priced at one-third its original price. The potential customer runs the Food Survivor website, which shows what outlets have what sort of food (baked foods, meals, produce, vegan food). available within a certain radius and in a specified timeslot, usually for 30 minutes or more. The customer can then purchase and collect a' magic box' within the designated timeslot.
